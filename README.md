# 🌌 SoniSpace – 3D Data Sonification System

A collaborative project developed as part of the **NASA International Space Apps Challenge**, where it was awarded **🥇 First Place in "Best Use of Technology"**.

SoniSpace is an innovative system that transforms complex 3D data models into **sound** through a process called **sonification**, allowing users to hear and interpret spatial structures in a completely new way.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔊 **3D Data Sonification**: Converts 3D models into unique audio representations.
- 🧠 **Educational Focus**: Helps students understand spatial and geometric concepts via sound.
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Makes complex visual data more accessible, especially for visually impaired users.
- 🛠️ **Modular Design**: Clean separation between system logic and interface, allowing for customization and extension.
- 🌐 **Built with Collaboration**: Designed and developed during the NASA Space Apps Challenge with a focus on real-world impact.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input**: A 3D model file (e.g., point cloud or mesh data).
2. **Processing**: The system analyzes the structure, depth, and spatial features.
3. **Sonification**: Maps data to audio frequencies and spatial cues.
4. **Output**: A unique audio stream representing the 3D model's structure.

## 💡 Use Cases

- 🎓 **Education**: Teach geometry and 3D thinking through interactive audio.
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Enable blind or visually impaired users to interpret 3D models.
- 🎨 **Art & Music**: Inspire creative audio-visual experiences using spatial data.
- 🛰️ **Science & Space**: Interpret 3D satellite or telescope data in new dimensions.
